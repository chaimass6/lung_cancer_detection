            <h2>What is Lung Cancer?</h2>
            <p>
                Lung cancer occurs when abnormal cells grow uncontrollably in the lungs, leading to the formation of tumors. 
                It interferes with the normal functioning of the lungs, which are vital for oxygen exchange in the body.
                Smoking, air pollution, and exposure to harmful substances are major contributors to this disease. 
                Lung cancer remains one of the deadliest types of cancer worldwide, but early detection and advancements in medical technology have improved survival rates.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Types of Lung Cancer</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC):</strong> The most common type, making up about 85% of cases. It includes subtypes such as adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell carcinoma.</li>
                <li><strong>Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC):</strong> A less common but aggressive form of lung cancer, typically associated with smoking.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Stages of Lung Cancer</h2>
            <p>
                Lung cancer progresses through distinct stages, each requiring different treatment approaches:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stage I:</strong> Cancer is localized and confined to the lungs.</li>
                <li><strong>Stage II:</strong> The tumor grows larger and may spread to nearby lymph nodes.</li>
                <li><strong>Stage III:</strong> Cancer has spread to lymph nodes in the chest or nearby organs.</li>
                <li><strong>Stage IV:</strong> Cancer has metastasized, spreading to distant organs like the brain, liver, or bones.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Common Symptoms</h2>
            <p>
                Lung cancer symptoms may vary depending on the stage of the disease. Common symptoms include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Persistent cough that doesnâ€™t go away</li>
                <li>Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing</li>
                <li>Chest pain, especially during deep breathing or coughing</li>
                <li>Unexplained weight loss and fatigue</li>
                <li>Coughing up blood or rust-colored sputum</li>
                <li>Hoarseness or changes in voice</li>
                <li>Frequent lung infections like bronchitis or pneumonia</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Risk Factors</h2>
            <p>
                Understanding the risk factors can help in prevention and early detection:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Smoking:</strong> The leading cause of lung cancer. Both active and passive smokers are at high risk.</li>
                <li><strong>Air Pollution:</strong> Prolonged exposure to polluted air increases the likelihood of developing lung cancer.</li>
                <li><strong>Radon Gas Exposure:</strong> A naturally occurring radioactive gas found in homes and buildings.</li>
                <li><strong>Family History:</strong> Genetics can play a role in predisposing individuals to lung cancer.</li>
                <li><strong>Exposure to Carcinogens:</strong> Asbestos, arsenic, and other harmful substances can lead to lung cancer over time.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Prevention and Early Detection</h2>
            <p>
                Taking proactive steps can significantly reduce the risk of lung cancer:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Quit smoking and avoid secondhand smoke exposure.</li>
                <li>Maintain indoor air quality by testing for radon and reducing pollutants.</li>
                <li>Wear protective gear if exposed to harmful chemicals in your workplace.</li>
                <li>Follow a healthy lifestyle with a balanced diet and regular exercise.</li>
                <li>Go for routine screenings, especially if you have a high-risk profile.</li>
            </ul>
