            <h2>What is Lung Cancer?</h2>
            <p>
                Lung cancer is a type of cancer that begins in the lungs, characterized by abnormal cell growth. These cells form tumors that hinder the lungs' ability to deliver oxygen to the body.
                Lung cancer is primarily categorized into two major types:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC):</strong> The most common type, accounting for about 85% of cases.</li>
                <li><strong>Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC):</strong> A more aggressive form, often linked to smoking.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Early symptoms may include persistent cough, shortness of breath, unexplained weight loss, and coughing up blood. Early detection through imaging techniques and AI-powered models 
                can significantly improve treatment outcomes.
